For you, my good son,
 this is all a test of faith.

And now,
 we need you to go to the East.

168

To the far side of Romania.

169
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,031
An accursed land...

170
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:51,076
terrorized by all sorts
 of nightmarish creatures.

171
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:54,496
CARDINAL: Lorded over
 by a certain Count Dracula.

172
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,165
VAN HELSING: Dracula?
 CARDINAL: Yes.

173

You've never faced one
 like this before.

174
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:04,714
Our story begins 450 years ago...

175
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:08,343
when a Transylvanian knight
 named Valerious the Elder...

176
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:12,138
promised God that his family
 would never rest nor enter heaven...

177
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:15,225
until they vanquished Dracula
 from their land.

178
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,727
They have not succeeded...

179
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,897
and they are running out of family.

180
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:26,069
CARDINAL: His descendant Boris Valerious,
 King of the Gypsies.

181
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,822
He disappeared almost 12 months ago.

182
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:35,245
CARDINAL: His only son, Prince Velkan,
 and his daughter, Princess Anna.

183
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,873
CARDINAL: If the two of them are killed
 before Dracula is vanquished...

184
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,042
nine generations of their family...

185
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:43,753
will never enter
 the gates of St. Peter.

186
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,214
For more than four centuries...

187
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:49,008
this family has defended
 our left flank.

188
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:50,969
They gave their lives.

189
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,389
We cannot let them
 slip into purgatory.

190
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,766
So you're sending me into hell.

191
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,395
In a manner.

192
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:07,235
Valerious the Elder left this here
 400 years ago.

193
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,612
We don't know its purpose...

194

but he would not have
 left it lightly.

"In the name of God,
 open this door."

197
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,416
There is an insignia.

198
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,881
Yes, it matches your ring.

199

I think that in Transylvania
 you may find the answer you seek.

 the son of Valerious the Elder.

 who murdered him?

CARL: No, there's just some vague reference
 to the Left Hand of God.

977
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:06,897
And in 1462, when Dracula died...

978
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:10,234
- he made a covenant with the Devil.
 -And was given a new life.

979
01:32:10,317 --> 01:32:13,362
But the only way he could sustain
 that life was by drinking blood.

And your ancestor,
 having sired this evil creature...

went to Rome to seek forgiveness.
 That's when the bargain was made.

He was to kill Dracula...

in return for eternal salvation
 of his entire family...

988
01:32:33,465 --> 01:32:36,343
As evil as Dracula was, my ancestor
 couldn't kill his own son.

989
01:32:36,385 --> 01:32:39,721
So he banished him
 to an icy fortress...

990
01:32:39,805 --> 01:32:42,474
sending him through a door
 from which there was no return.

991
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:44,434
- And then the Devil gave him wings.
 -Yes.

 kill his son, he left clues.

994

So that future generations
 might do it for him.

 was looking for in here.
